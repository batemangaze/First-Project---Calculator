# Python Calculator 🧮

A simple command-line calculator built using Python.  
This is my first Python project, created to practice core programming concepts.

---

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Uses Python `match-case`
- Handles invalid input
- Prevents division by zero
- Runs continuously until the user exits

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+

---

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-calculator.git
   ```

2. Go to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-calculator
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. Enter two numbers
2. Choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
3. View the result
4. Decide whether to continue or exit

## Learning Outcome

- User input handling
- Error handling with `try-except`
- Control flow using `match-case`
- Loops and condition checking

---

## Future Improvements

- Add more operations
- Improve user interface
- Add a graphical version
